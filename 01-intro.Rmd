# Introduction and motivation {#intro}

The goal of this chapter is to provide an introduction to multiple
changepoint detection algorithms, with an emphasis on methods that
have free/open-source implementations in R [@R-base]. Changepoint
detection algorithms are for analysis of sequential data sets.

```{r data}
data(neuroblastoma, package="neuroblastoma")

```

@Truong2018 provide an overview of the theoretical foundations for
multiple changepoint detection.
