# Introduction and motivation {#intro}

The goal of this chapter is to provide an introduction to multiple
changepoint detection algorithms, with an emphasis on methods that
have free/open-source implementations in R [@R-base]. Changepoint
detection algorithms are for analysis of sequential data sets.

```{r data}
data(neuroblastoma, package="neuroblastoma")

```

@Truong2018 provide an overview of the theoretical foundations for
multiple changepoint detection.

## Motivation for changepoint detection 

Changepoint detection algorithms are useful in a variety of real-world
applications.

- Detecting changes/abnormalities important in medicine.

- Detecting the time when a spike occurs is important in neuroscience.

![Neural spikes in calcium imaging data, Jewell et al, Biostatistics
2019.](intro-neuroscience)

- Detecting breakpoints is important in diagnosis of some types of
  cancer, such as neuroblastoma.

![DNA copy number data, breakpoints associated with aggressive cancer,
Hocking et al, Bioinformatics 2014.](intro-breakpoints)

- Detecting peaks (up/down changes) in genomic data is important in
  order to understand which genes are active or inactive.
